# Zone 3 â€“ Layer 08: IDS/IPS Presence (Low-Level Bash)

## Objective
Verify that host-based Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) are installed and running, such as Snort, Suricata, or OSSEC, using low-level Bash-only methods.

## Key Checks
- Detect presence and status of Snort
- Detect presence and status of Suricata
- Detect presence and status of OSSEC agent or server

---

## 1. Snort Detection

### Script: `snort_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep snort &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Snort IDS is running."
elif [ -f /etc/snort/snort.conf ]; then
  echo "[WARN] Snort is installed but not running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Snort not found."
fi
```

---

## 2. Suricata Detection

### Script: `suricata_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep suricata &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Suricata is running."
elif [ -f /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml ]; then
  echo "[WARN] Suricata is installed but not running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Suricata not found."
fi
```

---

## 3. OSSEC Detection

### Script: `ossec_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep ossec-agentd &>/dev/null || pgrep ossec-execd &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] OSSEC agent is active."
elif [ -d /var/ossec ]; then
  echo "[WARN] OSSEC appears installed but not running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] OSSEC not found."
fi
```

---

## Recommended Hardening
- Run at least one host-level IDS tool
- Ensure automatic startup and alerting is configured
- Store alerts remotely if possible

---

## Output Sample
```
[FAIL] Snort not found.
[PASS] Suricata is running.
[WARN] OSSEC appears installed but not running.
```

---

## Layer Status
PASS if:
- At least one IDS/IPS solution is active

WARN if:
- Installed but inactive

FAIL if:
- No detection of Snort, Suricata, OSSEC, or similar

N/A if:
- Not applicable due to network isolation or documented control
