# Zone 3 â€“ Layer 06: Web Servers and Services (Low-Level Bash)

## Objective
Verify the presence, status, and secure configuration of web servers (e.g., nginx, Apache) and ensure HTTPS enforcement and TLS best practices are in place.

## Key Checks
- Detect running web services (nginx or Apache)
- Check listening ports (80, 443)
- Verify presence of TLS configuration
- Confirm redirection from HTTP to HTTPS

---

## 1. Web Server Detection

### Script: `web_server_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep nginx &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[INFO] nginx is running."
elif pgrep httpd &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[INFO] Apache (httpd) is running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] No web server process (nginx or httpd) is currently running."
fi
```

### Explanation:
- Uses `pgrep` to detect if nginx or Apache is active without needing service commands

---

## 2. Listening Port Check (80/443)

### Script: `web_port_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

ss -tuln | grep -E ':80|:443' && echo "[PASS] Web ports 80/443 are listening." || echo "[FAIL] Neither port 80 nor 443 is open."
```

### Explanation:
- Uses `ss` to check if web server is actively listening on standard ports

---

## 3. TLS/SSL Certificate Configuration

### Script: `tls_certificate_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

cert_file=$(find /etc/nginx /etc/httpd -type f -name "*.crt" 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)

if [[ -n "$cert_file" ]]; then
  echo "[INFO] TLS certificate found: $cert_file"
  openssl x509 -in "$cert_file" -noout -text | grep -E 'Issuer:|Not After :'
else
  echo "[FAIL] No TLS certificate file (.crt) found in nginx or Apache directories."
fi
```

### Explanation:
- Locates and parses certificate info from `.crt` files used by nginx or Apache

---

## 4. HTTP to HTTPS Redirection (nginx example)

### Script: `https_redirect_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

config_file=$(find /etc/nginx -type f -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)

if grep -q "return 301 https://" "$config_file"; then
  echo "[PASS] HTTP to HTTPS redirection rule found."
else
  echo "[FAIL] No HTTPS redirect rule found in nginx config."
fi
```

### Explanation:
- Parses nginx configs for explicit HTTPS redirect (can be adapted for Apache with `.htaccess`)

---

## Recommended Hardening
- Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher only
- Disable insecure ciphers in web server config
- Ensure automatic certificate renewal (e.g., with cron + certbot)

---

## Output Sample
```
[INFO] nginx is running.
[PASS] Web ports 80/443 are listening.
[INFO] TLS certificate found: /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt
Issuer: Let's Encrypt
Not After : Oct 15 12:00:00 2024 GMT
[PASS] HTTP to HTTPS redirection rule found.
```

---

## Layer Status
PASS if:
- Web server is active
- Ports 80/443 are listening
- TLS certificate is present and valid
- HTTPS redirect rule is configured

FAIL if:
- Web server not running
- Ports closed or TLS missing
- No redirect found (HTTP served without security)
