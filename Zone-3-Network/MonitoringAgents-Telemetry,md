# Zone 3 â€“ Layer 07: Monitoring Agents and Telemetry (Low-Level Bash)

## Objective
Confirm the presence of basic monitoring agents and system telemetry tools to ensure visibility of system behavior, performance, and security events.

## Key Checks
- Check if standard monitoring agents are installed and running (Zabbix, Prometheus, Netdata)
- Verify system log presence
- Detect simple resource monitoring via process list

---

## 1. Zabbix Agent Detection

### Script: `zabbix_agent_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep zabbix_agentd &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Zabbix agent is running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Zabbix agent not detected."
fi
```

---

## 2. Prometheus Node Exporter Detection

### Script: `prometheus_node_exporter_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep node_exporter &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Prometheus node exporter is active."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Prometheus node exporter not found."
fi
```

---

## 3. Netdata Check

### Script: `netdata_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep netdata &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Netdata is active."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Netdata not running."
fi
```

---

## 4. System Logs Present

### Script: `syslog_presence_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

log_count=$(find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" | wc -l)

if [ "$log_count" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "[PASS] System logs are present."
else
  echo "[WARN] Few or no logs found in /var/log."
fi
```

---

## 5. Basic Monitoring with ps/top

### Script: `top_process_snapshot.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "[INFO] Top 5 CPU-consuming processes:"
ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu,%mem --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6
```

---

## Recommended Hardening
- Use at least one agent (Zabbix, Node Exporter, or Netdata)
- Rotate and centralize logs if possible
- Store metrics off-host for forensic resilience

---

## Output Sample
```
[PASS] Zabbix agent is running.
[FAIL] Prometheus node exporter not found.
[WARN] Few or no logs found in /var/log.
[INFO] Top 5 CPU-consuming processes:
  PID COMMAND %CPU %MEM
  123 nginx   1.3   0.7
```

---

## Layer Status
PASS if:
- At least one monitoring agent is active
- Logs exist and are not empty
- Basic telemetry can be queried

FAIL if:
- No monitoring solution present
- Logs missing or corrupted
