# Zone 3 â€“ Layer 05: Firewall and Monitoring (Low-Level Bash)

## Objective
Ensure basic host firewall rules are present and active using iptables or nftables, and that monitoring tools or log-based intrusion detection mechanisms are in place.

## Key Checks
- Firewall rules (using iptables or nftables)
- SSH port status
- fail2ban presence and log-based protections (basic detection)

---

## 1. Firewall Rules (iptables or nftables)

### Script: `firewall_rules_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for nftables
if command -v nft &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[INFO] nftables detected."
  nft list ruleset | grep -i 'tcp dport' | grep -E '80|443|22'

  if nft list ruleset | grep -qE 'tcp dport (80|443|22)'; then
    echo "[PASS] nftables has basic allow rules for SSH/HTTP/HTTPS."
  else
    echo "[FAIL] nftables does not show rules for common ports."
  fi

# Fallback to iptables
elif command -v iptables &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[INFO] iptables detected."
  iptables -L INPUT -n | grep -E 'dpt:80|dpt:443|dpt:22'

  if iptables -L INPUT -n | grep -qE 'dpt:80|dpt:443|dpt:22'; then
    echo "[PASS] iptables has basic allow rules for SSH/HTTP/HTTPS."
  else
    echo "[FAIL] iptables does not show rules for common ports."
  fi
else
  echo "[FAIL] No supported firewall tool (iptables or nft) found."
fi
```

### Explanation:
- Checks for active rules allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22)
- Works on both modern (nftables) and legacy (iptables) systems

---

## 2. fail2ban Detection

### Script: `fail2ban_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if command -v fail2ban-client &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[INFO] fail2ban is installed."
  fail2ban-client status sshd 2>/dev/null || echo "[WARN] fail2ban running but sshd jail not configured."
else
  echo "[WARN] fail2ban not found. Consider installing for log-based brute-force protection."
fi
```

### Explanation:
- Detects whether fail2ban is installed and active
- Checks if the SSH jail is being monitored

---

## Recommended Hardening
- Default deny all inbound except 22, 80, 443
- Log rate-limiting with iptables/nftables or fail2ban
- Enable alerts for login attempts or scans (optional extension)

---

## Output Sample
```
[INFO] nftables detected.
[PASS] nftables has basic allow rules for SSH/HTTP/HTTPS.

[INFO] fail2ban is installed.
[WARN] fail2ban running but sshd jail not configured.
```

---

## Layer Status
PASS if:
- SSH/HTTP/HTTPS are explicitly allowed
- Default policies restrict unnecessary inbound ports
- Monitoring tool (fail2ban or equivalent) is present or compensating mechanism is documented

FAIL if:
- Firewall rules are missing or allow all
- No monitoring system present

N/A if:
- Firewall handled externally (e.g., cloud security group, documented exception)
