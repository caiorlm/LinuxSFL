# Zone 3 â€“ Layer 10: Resilience and Failover (Low-Level Bash)

## Objective
Verify the presence and activity of redundancy mechanisms at the host level (e.g., HAProxy, Keepalived) to ensure system resilience and high availability.

## Key Checks
- Detect HAProxy service/process
- Detect Keepalived status
- Inspect virtual IP configuration (VIP)

---

## 1. HAProxy Detection

### Script: `haproxy_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep haproxy &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] HAProxy is running."
elif [ -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg ]; then
  echo "[WARN] HAProxy is installed but not running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] HAProxy not found."
fi
```

---

## 2. Keepalived Detection

### Script: `keepalived_detection.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if pgrep keepalived &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[PASS] Keepalived is active."
elif [ -f /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf ]; then
  echo "[WARN] Keepalived is installed but not running."
else
  echo "[FAIL] Keepalived not found."
fi
```

---

## 3. Virtual IP Check

### Script: `vip_check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "[INFO] Searching for assigned Virtual IPs (VIPs):"
ip addr | grep -E 'inet ' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'
```

### Explanation:
- This does not confirm whether VIPs are floating or manually assigned but provides visibility of non-loopback IPs bound to the system.

---

## Recommended Hardening
- HAProxy with health checks on backend services
- Keepalived configured with VRRP and priority logic
- Failover scripts for automatic failback in event of outage
- Monitor VIP status and failover behavior

---

## Output Sample
```
[PASS] HAProxy is running.
[FAIL] Keepalived not found.
[INFO] Searching for assigned Virtual IPs (VIPs):
inet 10.0.0.10/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global eth0
```

---

## Layer Status
PASS if:
- HAProxy and/or Keepalived are installed and active
- IPs are bound for failover logic

WARN if:
- Redundancy exists but is not running

FAIL if:
- No evidence of redundancy tools or VIP logic
