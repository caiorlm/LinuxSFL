# 📂 **Linux Root Filesystem Architecture (`/`) – LinuxSFL**

This document explains the Linux root filesystem, covering each primary directory’s purpose, typical contents, and their interactions during live system operation.

---

## 🌳 **1. Overview of Linux Root Filesystem**

The Linux filesystem begins at the root (`/`). All directories and files are organized hierarchically under this root directory. Each directory at this level has a specific purpose and role within the operating system, facilitating system functionality, management, and user interaction.

```bash
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

## 📂 **2. Detailed Explanation of Directories**

### 📌 `/bin` 
- **Purpose:** Contains essential binaries (executable programs) necessary for basic operations (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `bash`).
- **Interaction:** Critical for system usability, available at boot for all users.

---

### 📌 `/boot`
- **Purpose:** Holds files essential for system startup, such as kernel images (`vmlinuz`), initial RAM disks (`initramfs`), and bootloader configurations (GRUB2).
- **Interaction:** Used by bootloader during system startup to load and initialize kernel.

---

### 📌 `/dev`
- **Purpose:** Contains device files that represent hardware and virtual devices (e.g., disks `/dev/sda`, terminals `/dev/tty`, random generator `/dev/random`).
- **Interaction:** Allows kernel and userspace programs to communicate with hardware devices through standard filesystem interfaces.

---

### 📌 `/etc`
- **Purpose:** Contains system-wide configuration files and scripts (`/etc/fstab`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
- **Interaction:** Used by services and daemons at boot and runtime for configuration.

---

### 📌 `/home`
- **Purpose:** Stores personal user directories and data (e.g., `/home/user1`).
- **Interaction:** Accessed by users for storing personal files, documents, settings.

---

### 📌 `/lib` & `/lib64`
- **Purpose:** Essential shared libraries (`.so` files) required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **Interaction:** Linked at runtime by binaries to load functionality dynamically.

---

### 📌 `/media`
- **Purpose:** Mount points for removable media (USB drives, external disks).
- **Interaction:** Managed automatically by user-space tools for mounting/unmounting.

---

### 📌 `/mnt`
- **Purpose:** Manual or temporary mount points for system administrators.
- **Interaction:** Used manually (`mount`) for system maintenance tasks.

---

### 📌 `/opt`
- **Purpose:** Stores optional or additional third-party software installed manually.
- **Interaction:** Holds isolated applications, providing separation from system packages.

---

### 📌 `/proc`
- **Purpose:** Virtual filesystem providing kernel and system information (processes, hardware, runtime status).
- **Interaction:** Continuously updated in real-time by the kernel, allowing real-time monitoring (`htop`, `top`, `ps`).

---

### 📌 `/root`
- **Purpose:** Home directory of the root (administrator) user.
- **Interaction:** Used exclusively by the root user to store configuration and sensitive files.

---

### 📌 `/run`
- **Purpose:** Runtime data storage (process IDs, sockets, temporary files during boot/runtime).
- **Interaction:** Temporary, cleared at each reboot.

---

### 📌 `/sbin`
- **Purpose:** Contains system administration binaries (`fsck`, `iptables`, `fdisk`, `init`).
- **Interaction:** Essential tools for system maintenance tasks, typically accessible only to root or privileged users.

---

### 📌 `/srv`
- **Purpose:** Data directory for server services (`ftp`, `www`, etc.).
- **Interaction:** Services and applications use this directory to serve static and dynamic content.

---

### 📌 `/sys`
- **Purpose:** Virtual filesystem similar to `/proc`, provides information about kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and drivers.
- **Interaction:** Used by system tools (`udev`) and administrators to configure hardware parameters.

---

### 📌 `/tmp`
- **Purpose:** Temporary files storage accessible by all users.
- **Interaction:** Cleared frequently (usually on reboot or periodically by a system service).

---

### 📌 `/usr`
- **Purpose:** Secondary hierarchy containing user programs (`/usr/bin`), libraries (`/usr/lib`), documentation (`/usr/share/doc`), and source code.
- **Interaction:** Shared, read-only data used widely by user-installed software packages.

---

### 📌 `/var`
- **Purpose:** Holds variable data files (logs, databases, email messages, cache files).
- **Interaction:** Actively updated during runtime; critical for logging (`/var/log`) and application states (`/var/lib`).

---

## 🔄 **3. Live Interaction and Directory Communication**

During system execution, various directories continuously interact to ensure smooth and efficient operation. Here’s how some key interactions occur in real-time:

### 🚀 **System Boot Process (Interaction between `/boot`, `/lib`, `/etc`):**

1. Bootloader (GRUB) from `/boot` loads the kernel image (`vmlinuz`).
2. Kernel loads initial RAM filesystem (`initramfs`), enabling minimal system to mount the real root filesystem.
3. Kernel mounts `/` and reads configuration files from `/etc`, loads necessary shared libraries from `/lib`.

### 📊 **Hardware Interaction (between `/dev`, `/sys`, `/proc`):**

- Hardware devices connected to the system trigger events managed by kernel drivers (`/sys`).
- Device files (`/dev`) allow user-space programs to communicate directly with hardware.
- Real-time hardware information (`/proc` and `/sys`) enables monitoring and diagnostics (`htop`, `lsusb`, `lspci`).

### 📝 **Application and Service Configuration (between `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`):**

- Services (`systemd`, `sshd`) load configuration from `/etc`.
- Applications stored in `/usr` rely on data files from `/var` (databases, logs).
- During runtime, changes made to configurations in `/etc` affect application behavior stored in `/usr`.

### 📌 **Runtime Monitoring and Diagnostics (interaction among `/proc`, `/sys`, `/var/log`):**

- Monitoring tools (`top`, `htop`, `ps`) continuously access `/proc` for real-time process data.
- Hardware and device status is available live through `/sys`.
- System and application logs continuously generated and stored in `/var/log`.

## 🖥️ **Real-time Example:**

Checking interactions on a live Linux system:

```bash
# Monitor CPU info live
cat /proc/cpuinfo

# Real-time process monitoring
htop 

# Checking current kernel and boot parameters
cat /proc/cmdline 

# Real-time network device details
ls /sys/class/net/

# Active devices and their device nodes
ls -l /dev
```

These commands demonstrate how various directories cooperate dynamically during system operation, creating a fully functional and secure Linux environment.

## 🔑 **Best Practices for Managing Filesystem Structure:**

- **Keep `/boot` secure**: Protect bootloader and kernel files.
- **Monitor `/var/log` regularly**: To identify issues proactively.
- **Limit permissions in `/etc` and `/usr`**: Prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Regularly clean `/tmp`**: Avoid potential exploits via temporary files.
