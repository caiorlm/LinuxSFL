# Package Management

## Overview
Package management is essential for maintaining software and its dependencies on Linux systems. It enables administrators to install, update, remove, and manage software packages efficiently.

## Package Managers

### 1. DPKG (Debian Package Manager)
DPKG is a low-level package manager used primarily in Debian-based distributions.

**Key Commands:**

- Install a package:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i package_name.deb
```
- Remove a package:
```bash
sudo dpkg -r package_name
```
- Purge a package (remove including configuration files):
```bash
sudo dpkg -P package_name
```
- List installed packages:
```bash
dpkg -l
```

### 2. APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)
APT is a high-level front-end for DPKG used extensively in Ubuntu and Debian distributions.

**Key Commands:**

- Update repositories:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
- Upgrade installed packages:
```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Search for packages:
```bash
apt search package_name
```
- Install a package:
```bash
sudo apt install package_name
```
- Remove a package:
```bash
sudo apt remove package_name
```
- Purge a package completely:
```bash
sudo apt purge package_name
```

### 3. YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified)
YUM is the older default package manager for RPM-based distributions such as CentOS 7 and older Red Hat distributions.

**Key Commands:**

- Install a package:
```bash
sudo yum install package_name
```
- Update all packages:
```bash
sudo yum update
```
- Remove a package:
```bash
sudo yum remove package_name
```
- List available updates:
```bash
yum check-update
```

### 4. RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)
RPM is a low-level package manager used by Red Hat, Fedora, and other RPM-based distributions.

**Key Commands:**

- Install a package:
```bash
sudo rpm -ivh package_name.rpm
```
- Upgrade a package:
```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh package_name.rpm
```
- Query installed packages:
```bash
rpm -qa
```
- Remove a package:
```bash
sudo rpm -e package_name
```

### 5. DNF (Dandified Yum)
DNF is the modern successor to YUM, the default package manager in Fedora, RHEL 8/9, and CentOS Stream.

**Key Commands:**

- Install a package:
```bash
sudo dnf install package_name
```
- Update packages:
```bash
sudo dnf upgrade
```
- Remove a package:
```bash
sudo dnf remove package_name
```
- Search for packages:
```bash
dnf search package_name
```
- Check available updates:
```bash
dnf check-update
```

## Recommendations

- Always update repositories before installing packages.
- Prefer high-level tools (APT, DNF) for easier dependency management.
- Reserve low-level tools (DPKG, RPM) for advanced use cases or troubleshooting.
